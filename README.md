## Student Grade Generator

### Problem Description
This challenge involves creating a program that prompts the user to input student marks (between 0 and 100) and returns the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
- **A > 79**
- **B: 60 to 79**
- **C: 50 to 59**
- **D: 40 to 49**
- **E: Less than 40**

The program should validate the input to ensure it is within the acceptable range.

## Speed Detector

### Problem Description
This challenge requires creating a program that takes the speed of a car as input and checks if it is within the speed limit (70 km/s). If the speed exceeds the limit, the program should calculate demerit points:
- **1 point for every 5 km/s above 70**.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, their license should be suspended.

The program should also handle invalid input gracefully.

- **Payee (Tax)**: Based on KRA tax slabs.
- **NHIF Deductions**: Simplified rates.
- **NSSF Deductions**: Fixed rate of 1080.

The program should display the gross salary, deductions, and net salary.
